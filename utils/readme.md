# Simple routines from sigpyproc3
### Gaussian Data generator in Sigproc Filterbank format.
<br />
##### Usage
`python gaussian_filterbank.py --args`
<br /> <br /> You will require latest version of **numpy, sigpyproc** installed to run the code.

### msgpack_to_nparray_convert.py
This code can be used for converting/ extracting the numpy arrays from the msgpack files conveniently and then the extracted numpy arrays are converted and saved to npz file.
<br />
##### Usage
`python msgpack_to_nparray_convert.py --args` 
<br /> <br /> In future a msgpack to filterbank converter will be maybe added here which could be useful if waterfallig is to be done by sigpyproc3 library.
