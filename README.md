# CluCHIME
## Introduction
This is a Python library with necessary software pipelines for handling radio astronomical data from 3 beams/detectors from CHIME/FRB instrument and performing CLUSTERING ANALYSIS and RFI removal on the multi beam data.

The CluCHIME library and the tools here were made during my MSc thesis at TATA INSTITUTE OF FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH under guidance of Dr. Shriharsh      Tendulkar.

The intensity-analysis utils library was developed by Dr. Shriharsh Tendulkar et al at CHIME/FRB Collaboration. 


## Requirments
For running CluCHIME library successfully you will  need 
`numpy, scipy, intensity-analysis utils,frb-common,  DM_phase, frb-constant, sigpyproc3, simpulse libraries` preinstalled. 

The `frb-common, frb-constants, intensity-analysis utils` libraries are closed CHIME/FRB libraries from GITHUB. 

## Installation
`git clone https://github.com/lukekevin/CluCHIME.git`
