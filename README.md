# CluCHIME
## Introduction
This is a Python library for handling radio astronomical data from 3 beams/detectors from CHIME/FRB instrument and performing CLUSTERING ANALYSIS and RFI removal on the multi beam data.The data format used is .msgpack which is the format used for the INTENSITY data generated by the CHIME/FRB pipeline.      However with minimal modifications to inputs the library can also  be used for multi beam data from any radio interferometric telescope. The CluCHIME library and the tools here were made during my MSc thesis at TATA INSTITUTE OF FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH under guidance of Dr. Shriharsh      Tendulkar. This CluCHIME library also streamlines and eases the various relevant data  analysis from IAUTILS Python library. The intensity-analysis utils library was developed by Dr. Shriharsh Tendulkar et al at CHIME/FRB Collaboration. 

## Requirments
For running CluCHIME library successfully you will  need `numpy, scipy, intensity-analysis utils,frb-common,  DM_phase, frb-constant libraries` preinstalled. The `frb-common, frb-constants, intensity-analysis utils` libraries are closed CHIME/FRB libraries from GITHUB. 

## Installation
`git clone https://github.com/lukekevin/CluCHIME.git`
